Balance sheet is a snapshot of a companie's financials. It shows the accmulated depriciation for all the assets.
$$Assets - Liabilities = Equity$$
This is the key equation to be followed. 

There are 2 types of assets.

1. **Fixed assets**  
    These are assets that take time to be liquidated. Plants, property and equipments fall under it.

2. **Current assets**  
    Assets that can be converted to cash within a year. Cash on hand, marketable securities, receivables and inventory.

**Mergers & Aquisitions** are also assets. If the cost paid to acquire is above the market price then is said to be a goodwill cost. It includes an estimation of the value given to the intellectual property, reputations and the brand acquired.

**Current Liabilities** is money owed to creditors and payable in the next year. Short term loans, accrued salaries. accrued taxes, accounts payable, current long term loan payable and bond mortgages  are involved in it.

**Owner's equity** are the retained earnings after paying divedends to shareholders and taxes.

**Working capital** is the money tie din current operations.

$$WorkingCapital = CurrentLiabilities - CurrentAssets$$

**Financial leverage** is making money on debt which is equally risky. Investors look on Debt2Equity ratio to judge.

**COGS**: Cost of goods sold.
